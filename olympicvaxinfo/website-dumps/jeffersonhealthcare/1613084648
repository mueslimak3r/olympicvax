Vaccine Update, Wednesday, February 10, 2021
Vaccine Supply:
As shared in Monday’s update, Jefferson Healthcare ordered 975 Pfizer first dose/primary shots, 500 Moderna first dose/primary shots, and 200 Moderna second dose/booster shots from the Department of Health. We expect to learn the results of our order no later than Thursday, 2/11. If our order is approved, it will be shipped over the weekend and received Monday, 2/15. Upon order confirmation, we will resume scheduling first/primary dose shots and operate the vaccination clinic daily until all vaccine is administered. If our order is rejected, we will place another order next Monday.

Vaccine Supply/Demand Imbalance:
The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) announced today, that 446,750 (165,750 1st doses and 281,100 2nd doses) doses were requested from Washington State providers this week and our state will receive 206,125 (113,800 1st doses and 92,325 2nd doses) from the federal government. This exemplifies the extreme vaccine supply/demand imbalance our state is grappling with.
Further, the state has high expectations for how quickly shots are administered. Vaccination sites are required to use 95% of each allocation within 7 days of receipt. The DOH closely monitors allocations and throughput and if a provider has more than 5% of their recently shipped allocation still on hand at the end of the period, future allocations are reduced by that amount. The weekly look back period is Monday through Sunday of the previous week. While we applaud the state’s efforts to incentivize rapid delivery of vaccinations, such a focus on the efficiency of delivery may conflict with a more thoughtful approach to reaching our most medically frail and other vulnerable, hard to reach populations, communities, and technology free households.
Vaccine Clinic:
The Drive Thru Immunization Clinic has been open every day this week and kept a steady pace since Saturday providing 1094 second/booster dose shots. To date, we have provided 5,692 total vaccinations and completed 2,188 two dose regimens, representing 9% of our population.  We expect to provide 1,080 (today, tomorrow, and Friday) second dose/booster vaccinations completing the two-shot regimen for 94% of patients who received their 1st dose.
We plan to administer first/primary dose vaccinations (300-400) on Monday. 200 vaccinations have been designated for patients in our oldest age cohort, 85+ and 100-200 have been designated for patients 75+ and identified as high clinical risk/medically fragile and eligible patients of underserved populations within our community.
 Vaccinating the most vulnerable members of our community is a priority for Jefferson Healthcare. Statistically, these populations are the most at risk to be hospitalized and potentially die from the disease. Our Population Health Department and Medical Staff Leadership have worked closely to identify these community members.
Vaccine Supply Assessment:
There remains a nationwide shortage of vaccine supply. However, the amount of vaccine allotted to the state of Washington will incrementally increase later in the month, and we expect this 10% increase to be maintained. This is good news for vaccine desperate communities like ours.
Week Ending February 7, 2021 – 207,100
Week Ending February 14, 2021 – 206,125
Week Ending February 21, 2021 – 240, 620

Tell me when it's my turn! I'm over 65 years old.


Listen to KPTZ’s Through Science to Health as Dr. Mattern gives an overview of logistics, from supply and allocation to scheduling. He emphasizes the importance of following protocols, even after receiving the second dose. He also discusses the variants of the virus, dosage efficacy, and projections for getting our population here in the county vaccinated.

Who is eligible to schedule a vaccination in Jefferson County?We will resume scheduling and vaccinating first dose patients the moment additional vaccines become available.
Anyone 65 years and older can register to be notified when Jefferson Healthcare is again scheduling first doses.
Register to be notified when it's your turn.Use the button above to submit your name, email and birthdate to be notified when it is your turn.
For those 64 and younger, it’s not your turn yet.  Check back to the website frequently to learn when registration for notifications opens.
Notification email does not guarantee an appointment. It does eliminate the need to check the site daily to see if a new age band has opened.
How can I make a COVID-19 Immunization appointment?We have paused all future appointments until additional shipments of vaccine are received from the state.  We will continue to update our website with new information as it becomes available. Volunteers at Emergency Management will not be answering calls during this time.
The State says I’m eligible because I’m over 65, why won’t Jefferson Healthcare vaccinate me now?Jefferson County is the oldest county in the state, 12,000 of our residents (more than 1/4 of our population) are over the age of 65.  At this time, we have not been allocated enough vaccine to do a complete immunization rollout for phase 1B.  The county public health officer and our Chief Medical Officer believe it is imperative to immunize our oldest and most vulnerable community members first.  Starting with the oldest population protects the most at risk for hospitalization and death from COVID-19.
I am 50 years and older and I live in multigenerational household taking care of my grandchildren/parent/family member. When can I get vaccinated?For now, we will focus on 65+ population until clarification from State on the multigenerational component.  Once we have a better understanding of our vaccine shipments from the state we can open to include this important population segment.
What about vaccinating other household members?Until we receive further instruction from the state we are only vaccinating by age.
How quickly will scheduling open to younger patients?The more vaccine we receive, the more we can schedule.  We rely on the State to supply us with vaccine and we have requested large enough quantity to cover us until it arrives.
Why are we only vaccinating Jefferson County Residents and Jefferson Healthcare patients?The state is basing vaccine allocation on county population,  Jefferson Healthcare’s primary responsibility is to county residents and the patients we serve.
When are you going to open a mass immunization clinic similar to other communities?Jefferson Healthcare has received several allocation of Pfizer vaccine, which consists of 975 doses in each allocation.   Once we receive larger allocations, we will begin to open up broader age bands and possibly, large scale vaccination events.
Once I have an appointment, where will I go to get a COVID-19 Immunization?All immunization will occur by appointment only at the Jefferson Healthcare Drive-Thru Immunization Clinic located on 7th & Cleveland Street behind the Manresa Castle.

If I choose not to get vaccinated when my phase begins will I be able to schedule at a later tier?Past phases will always be eligible for vaccination and those individuals can schedule based on availability of vaccine.
I have scheduled my appointment but need to change the date or time. What do I do?The COVID-19 Vaccine line can help change previously scheduled appointments 360.344.3097.  Do not call to schedule your first appointment.
I am phase 1A can I still get vaccinated?Past phases will always be eligible for vaccination if supply is on hand. Individuals who qualify for phase 1A are still eligible to receive immunization once additional vaccine is received from the state.  Those who qualify can email vaccineresponse@jeffersonhealthcare.org for further instructions.
Are there reactions to the vaccine?Some individuals report vaccine reactions after receiving the vaccine.  It is important to talk with your primary care provider if you have a history of allergic reactions to any vaccine, injectable or any component of the COVID-19 vaccine (for more information, see the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Emergency Use Approval Fact Sheet).

The CDC recently posted this article: Allergic Reactions Including Anaphylaxis After Receipt of the First Dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine — United States, December 14–23, 2020
Do I still need to wear a mask after my vaccine?Yes, wearing a mask provides an additional layer of protection.  The same way social distancing and hand washing provide layers.  When you receive the vaccine you have an additional layer of protection.
I would like to volunteer to help with vaccination efforts.Reach out to EOC to become preregistered as an emergency volunteer jcdem@co.jefferson.wa.us 
Is there any reason I would not be able to schedule right now?
Not have had a lab-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in the last 10 days
Not be sick with symptoms of fever, cough, body aches, chills, shortness of breath, sore throat, fatigue, congestion, runny nose, headache, loss of taste or smell, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea
Not have had contact with a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 in the last 14 days
Not be allergic to any component of the COVID-19 vaccine (for more information, see the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Emergency Use Approval Fact Sheet)
Which vaccine is Jefferson Healthcare administering?We are currently vaccinating with the Pfizer vaccine allocated to us by the Washington State Department of Health.  The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses no sooner than 17 days between doses.  Vaccine doses must be the same brand.  First dose Pfizer must receive second dose Pfizer.
Can I get vaccinated anywhere else?Jefferson Healthcare is partnering with Tri-Area Pharmacy in Port Hadlock for vaccination.  The Pharmacy is following the same age band criteria Jefferson Healthcare is using.
There are other vaccination locations throughout the state.
Vaccination brands must stay consistent.  If you receive Pfizer vaccine for your first dose you must receive Pfizer for your second dose and the same is true for Moderna.
What is the next phase to be eligible for vaccination?On January 6, 2021, the Washington State Department of Health announced the tiered approach to phase 1b.  The state has not moved to 1b, information was announced for planning purposes.  This new information allows Jefferson Healthcare to enhance our distribution plan to serve the community efficiently, equitably as well as forecast inventory deliveries from the state.  Our organization is currently busy scheduling phase 1a vaccinations and we need to be able to focus on them in the short term. We will reach out to the community with the next steps, once we know more.  Please continue to visit our website.
